## Why This Project Exists
This is not just another landing page clone.  
This is a **masterclass in modern frontend craftsmanship** – a full-stack animation experience that pushes the limits of what’s possible in the browser using:
- Scroll-synced 3D model animations
- Cinematic lighting & environment mapping
- Masking reveals, pinned timelines, parallax
- Video scrubbing on scroll
- Butter-smooth 60 FPS performance even on mobile

Built purely to practice and master **GSAP + Three.js + React Three Fiber** at an Apple-level execution.
